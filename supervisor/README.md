## The full workflow

### Step 1 — One-time setup per agent (each machine)

Each agent needs a config file at `~/agents/<agent-name>/config`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/agents/agent-be
cat > ~/agents/agent-be/config <<EOF
CONTROL_REPO_URL=git@github.com:your-org/your-control-repo.git
WORK_REPO_URL=git@github.com:your-org/your-backend-repo.git
AGENT_DOMAIN=be
EOF
```

Repeat for `agent-fe`, `agent-qa`, `agent-doc`. The `WORK_REPO_URL` is empty for QA/doc agents that only commit to the control repo.

**Optional — enable cross-machine Supabase wake (add to each config):**

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon-or-service-role-key>
```

### Step 2 — Edit `fleet.conf` to match your agents

```
# supervisor/fleet.conf
agent-be    FEATURE_ROLE.md    claude-sonnet-4-6
agent-fe    FEATURE_ROLE.md    claude-sonnet-4-6
agent-qa    QA_ROLE.md         claude-sonnet-4-6
agent-doc   DOC_ROLE.md        claude-sonnet-4-6
```

### Step 3 — Choose: development mode or production mode

**Development** (one terminal, agents run in the background, stop when you kill the terminal):

```bash
cd supervisor/
./fleet.sh start    # starts all 4 agents in the background
./fleet.sh status   # see who's running / working / idle
./fleet.sh logs     # tail all 4 logs merged in one stream, Ctrl-C to exit
./fleet.sh stop     # stop all
```

**Production** (agents survive reboot, restart on crash, no terminal window needed):

```bash
cd supervisor/
./fleet.sh install    # registers all 4 as launchd services (macOS)
                      # they start immediately and persist after logout
./fleet.sh status     # shows "service:running" per agent
./fleet.sh uninstall  # removes the services when you're done
```

No need to open four terminals. Everything is driven from `fleet.sh`.

### What `./fleet.sh status` shows

```
AGENT           MODE        STATE     DETAIL
------------------------------------------------------------
agent-be        service     running   [agent-be] iteration start @ control:a3f9c2
agent-fe        bg          idle      2026-06-15T10:42:00Z
agent-qa        bg          working
agent-doc       stopped
```

- **service** — installed via `fleet.sh install`, managed by the OS
- **bg** — started via `fleet.sh start`, runs in the background of this session
- **stopped** — not running (config exists but agent was never started)

## Real-time collaboration (v7)

The v7 supervisor adds five layers so agents respond to each other in seconds rather than minutes:

| Layer | What it does | Latency |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Process supervision | Agents restart on crash via launchd/systemd | — |
| Fast idle polling | `git ls-remote` every 5s (was 30s) | ≤5s |
| Local wake file | Supervisor writes `mailboxes/wake/<agent>` after each push | <1s |
| Supabase Realtime | Cross-machine broadcast via `wake-listen.ts` | ~1s |
| Parallel answer sessions | Detects incoming `awaiting_info` questions mid-session, spawns a focused answer session in a separate git worktree | ~10s |

End-to-end round-trip for an `awaiting_info` Q&A: **~15–30 seconds** (dominated by LLM response time), down from potentially hours with the v6 async mailbox-only approach.

## Console intercept — risk-gated Bash tool access (v7.1)

Agents use the Claude Bash tool for all shell operations. To prevent accidental or malicious high-risk commands from executing silently, a thin wrapper at `supervisor/console/bin/bash` intercepts Bash invocations and gates destructive operations.

### How it works

1. **Prepended to PATH.** `run-agent.sh` exports `$SUPERVISOR_DIR/console/bin` first on PATH, so every Bash tool call (from Claude) hits the wrapper before the system bash.

2. **Risk classification.** The wrapper identifies high-risk patterns anywhere in the command string (including chained commands like `cd /tmp && git push`):
   - Git mutations: `git push`, `git rebase`, `git reset`
   - Destructive file ops: `rm -rf`, `chmod -R`, `chown -R`
   - Data/device access: `curl | bash`, `wget | bash`, `dd if=`, `mkfs`, `fdisk`

3. **Low-risk pass-through.** Commands like `git clone`, `ls`, `npm install` execute immediately without gating.

4. **High-risk intercept.** When a high-risk command is detected:
   - Wrapper writes a JSON request file to `$SUPERVISOR_DECISIONS_DIR/<agent>-<request-id>.json`
   - Logs the command to stderr: `[bash-wrapper] HIGH RISK — blocked, awaiting console decision`
   - Polls for an approval response file (`<agent>-<request-id>.decision.json`)
   - If `{"approved": true}` — executes the command
   - If `{"approved": false}` or timeout — blocks and exits with code 1

5. **Fallback when console is down.** If `$SUPERVISOR_DECISIONS_DIR` is not set, the wrapper blocks with a warning and does NOT execute the command. This prevents silent execution when the console is unavailable.

### Accessing decision files

Decision files are stored at `$SUPERVISOR_DIR/console/decisions/<agent>-<id>.json`:

```json
{
  "command": "git push origin main",
  "risk": "high",
  "agent": "agent-be",
  "request_id": "1718825000-1234-56789"
}
```

The console (or human operator) creates a response file with the same name, appending `.decision`:

```json
{
  "approved": true
}
```

## Console server — zero-config control repo discovery (v7.1)

The console server reads task ledgers, mailboxes, and decision files from the control repository. To eliminate manual env setup, `supervisor/console/server.ts` auto-detects the control repo on startup.

### How auto-detection works

When you start the console server:

1. **Check env override.** If `CONTROL_DIR` is set, use that path directly (backward-compatible fallback). Skip the next steps.

2. **Resolve control repo URL.** Read `supervisor/fleet.conf` (same directory as run-agent.sh), skip comment lines and blank lines, take the first agent name. Then read the git remote URL:
   ```bash
   git -C ~/agents/<first-agent>/control remote get-url origin
   ```
   This gives the control repo URL without requiring a separate config file.

3. **Clone if needed.** If `~/agents/console/control` does not exist, clone the control repo there:
   ```bash
   git clone <url> ~/agents/console/control
   ```
   This is a **blocking operation** — the HTTP server does not bind until the clone succeeds.

4. **Skip if already present.** If `~/agents/console/control` already exists, start immediately without re-cloning.

5. **Graceful failure.** If the clone fails (network error, bad URL, missing repo), the server exits with a non-zero code and logs a descriptive error. It does NOT start a server without the control repo.

### Startup log example

```bash
$ bun run supervisor/console/server.ts
[console] CONTROL_DIR not set, auto-detecting...
[console] First agent from fleet.conf: agent-be
[console] Reading control URL from ~/agents/agent-be/control/.git/config
[console] Control URL: git@github.com:my-org/my-control-repo.git
[console] Cloning control repo from git@github.com:my-org/my-control-repo.git...
[console] Clone complete at ~/agents/console/control
[console] Starting HTTP server on port 7842
```

### Setup implications

**Old workflow** (before v7.1):
```bash
CONTROL_DIR=/path/to/control bun run supervisor/console/server.ts
```

**New workflow** (v7.1):
```bash
bun run supervisor/console/server.ts
```

The server now reads `fleet.conf` to find the control repo without manual setup. Operators upgrading from v7.0 can delete any hardcoded `CONTROL_DIR` exports in their systemd/launchd service files.

## Console UI — design system (v7.1)

The console frontend uses a dark-theme design system coordinated with `docs/DESIGN.md`.

### Typefaces
- **Satoshi** (display/hero) — loaded from Fontshare CDN (weights: 400, 500, 700)
- **DM Sans** (body/UI) — loaded from Google Fonts (weights: 400, 500, 600)
- **JetBrains Mono** (data/code) — loaded from Google Fonts (weights: 400, 500)

All fonts use `display=swap` to prevent invisible text during font load.

### Design tokens
Sourced from `docs/DESIGN.md` and defined in `:root` of `styles.css`:

| Token | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `--base` | `#0C0C0C` | Page background |
| `--surface` | `#141414` | Cards, sections |
| `--surface-2` | `#1C1C1C` | Elevated surfaces |
| `--border` | `#262626` | Dividers, outlines |
| `--text` | `#FAFAFA` | Primary text |
| `--text-dim` | `#A1A1AA` | Secondary text |
| `--text-micro` | `#52525B` | Captions, hints |
| `--amber` | `#F59E0B` | Accent (warnings, CTAs) |
| `--green` | `#22C55E` | Success state |
| `--red` | `#EF4444` | Error state |
| `--blue` | `#3B82F6` | Info state |

### Motion variables
Used for consistent timing across transitions and animations:

| Variable | Value | Use case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `--dur-micro` | 75ms | Micro-interactions (hover, focus) |
| `--dur-short` | 150ms | Quick transitions (fade, slide) |
| `--dur-medium` | 250ms | Page transitions |
| `--ease-enter` | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` | Entrance animations (bounce) |
| `--ease-exit` | `cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0)` | Exit animations (ease-out) |

### Visual effects
- **Grain texture:** `body::after` pseudo-element with SVG `feTurbulence` at 0.03 opacity (fixed position, z-index 9999, non-interactive). Adds subtle surface texture without impacting readability.

### Font sizing
- Body text: 16px (see `docs/DESIGN.md` for rationale)
- Button border-radius: 8px (consistent with accessibility guidelines)

## Adding a new agent

1. Add a line to `fleet.conf`
2. Create `~/agents/<new-agent>/config` on the target machine
3. Run `./fleet.sh start` (or `./fleet.sh install` for production)
